# 📻 AM Transmitter – Analog Audio Broadcast System

This project demonstrates the design and construction of an **AM (Amplitude Modulation) transmitter** capable of broadcasting analog audio signals over radio frequencies. The system uses RF circuits, a modulator, and an antenna system to achieve real-time transmission of audio from a mobile or microphone input.

## 🧭 Project Overview

The transmitter modulates a high-frequency carrier wave based on the amplitude of an incoming audio signal. The result is an amplitude-modulated wave that can be received by standard AM radios. This project focuses on circuit-level design, modulation theory, antenna tuning, and real-world testing.
